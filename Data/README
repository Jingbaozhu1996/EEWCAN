Due to the large memory size of waveform data and limitations in data transmission, 
we uploaded the waveform dataset to IEEE Dataport. The datasets used for training and testing EEWCAN model 
and baseline models(CNN-Dis、CRNN-Dis、CNN-Mag、LSTM-Mag、MEANet-Mag、MagNet、EqViT), 
as well as Chinese strong-ground motion test dataset, can be downloaded from IEEE Dataport. Here is the link to IEEE Dataport:
